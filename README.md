AI Email Sorter:

Tired of sifting through endless emails? This project uses the power of AI to automatically sort your inbox into neat categories like "Support", "Sales", and "Spam". It's like having a super-efficient assistant, but without the coffee breaks! ðŸ˜‰

What's Inside?

AI Magic: We've harnessed Large Language Models (think ChatGPT, but for emails) to understand the content of your emails and put them where they belong.
AWS Power: We've built this on Amazon Web Services, so it's reliable and scalable.
Your Rules: You decide what categories you want and how to label them.
Future Ready: We've designed this with growth in mind. Imagine connecting it to your CRM or helpdesk system!

How it Works

  It's a bit like a mailroom, but way cooler:
  
  New Email Arrives: Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES) gets the mail.
  AI Steps In: A clever AWS Lambda function reads the email and sends it to our AI model.
  AI Decides: The AI figures out what the email is about and gives it a label.
  Safekeeping: We store the email and its label in a secure spot (Amazon S3 or DynamoDB).
  (Optional) Alerts: If you want, we can send you a notification when certain types of emails arrive.

Ready to Try it?
You'll Need:

An Amazon Web Services account.
Some basic knowledge of AWS (SES, Lambda, S3/DynamoDB, SNS).
Access to an AI model API (like OpenAI's GPT).

Let's Get Started:

Grab the Code: Clone (or download) this repository.
Set Up AWS: Follow our instructions to get the AWS services up and running.
AI Connection: Connect your AI model to the project.


Make it Yours:
Tell the AI Your Rules: Edit the code to tell the AI what categories you want.
Connect the Dots: Configure SES to send new emails to the Lambda function.
Choose Your Storage: Pick S3 or DynamoDB to store your sorted emails.
(Optional) Notifications: Set up Amazon SNS if you want alerts.
